# Terraform-CaseStudy1
This repo will create a VPC, RDS and webserver on AWS.
If using this repo for personal practice, before running Terraform destroy, go ahead and delete the database from the AWS console and do not save backups or snapshots. Ensure the database is deleted completely before running Terraform Apply.
